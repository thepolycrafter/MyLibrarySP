    <!-- Help -->
    <string name="help_read_books_question">Can I read books within My Library?</string>
    <string name="help_read_books_answer">No! As stated in the Google Play description, My Library is an app that allows you to list and sort your library. It is not a book reader. There are a lot of book readers on Android but My Library is not one of them.</string>
    <string name="help_lent_to_question">How can I indicate that I lent my book to a friend?</string>
    <string name="help_lent_to_answer">Use the comments section: if your friend\'s name is John, then indicate \"Lent to\" as \"comment title\" and \"John\" as \"comment content\".</string>
    <string name="help_delete_question">How can I delete a book?</string>
    <string name="help_delete_answer">Just long press the book, and you will be able to delete it.</string>
    <string name="help_from_wishlist_to_library_question">How can I move an item from my wishlist to my library?</string>
    <string name="help_from_wishlist_to_library_answer">Just long press the item in the wishlist, and you will be able to move it to your library.</string>
    <string name="help_number_of_books_question">Can I have an infinite number of books in my library?</string>
    <string name="help_number_of_books_answer">Yes you can!</string>
    <string name="help_convert_books_to_comics_question">I already add all my comics to the book list and I want to use the comic list!</string>
    <string name="help_convert_books_to_comics_answer">No worries, just long press a book / a comic and you will be able to convert books to comics and comics to books instantly!</string>
    <string name="help_use_single_list_question">I don\'t want to use the comic list, I want to have a single list with my books and my comics</string>
    <string name="help_use_single_list_answer">No problem, you can still add comics to the book list :)</string>
    <string name="help_isbn_format_question">What is the wanted ISBN format?</string>
    <string name="help_isbn_format_answer"><![CDATA[An example of valid ISBN : 2–07–042277–1<br />The dashes are accepted for readability matters, but they are not mandatory, therefore you will get the same result with 2070422771. Give it a try!]]></string>
    <string name="help_isbn_apis_question">How does the app match books and ISBN numbers?</string>
    <string name="help_isbn_apis_answer">My Library uses Google, Amazon, Open Library, IsbnPlus, Worldcat and Biblio services in order to match ISBN numbers and the books you are looking for, therefore if an ISBN number is not found, it is because it is not referenced within those services. Unfortunately this is out of my reach, but I\'ll keep an eye on new available book services, and rest assured, the best ones will be added in future updates.</string>
    <string name="help_improve_database_question">Can I improve the app database by any mean?</string>
    <string name="help_improve_database_answer"><![CDATA[Yes you can! Just create an account at <a href=\"https://openlibrary.org\">Open Library</a> and start adding books!]]></string>
    <string name="help_save_data_question">How can I save my data?</string>
    <string name="help_save_data_answer"><![CDATA[You have many ways to save your data, which can be divided in two categories: the database and the covers. For details on covers export / import, go to the next question. You can:<br /><br />- Export \"mylibrary.db\" file. This is your database. You cannot read it but you can import your data on any other device with nothing else but with file.<br /><br />- Export \"MyLibrary.xls\" file. This file is an Excel representation of your database. You can do whatever you want with it and use it to recover your data with XLS import if you want. I would not recommend to use XLS import if you can use database import instead but you\'re a free human being so do as you like!<br /><br />- Export \"MyLibraryByAuthor.xls\" file. This file is similar to \"MyLibrary.xls\" file but is sorted by author. It cannot be imported.<br /><br />When importing, you can choose to \"override current library\". If this is checked, then all your current data will be deleted and replaced by the imported one. If not checked, all the imported data will be merged to your current data. This can be very useful if you want to scan your library with multiple phones and then merge data, but be aware that this can result in doubles.]]></string>
    <string name="help_export_import_covers_question">How can I export / import my covers from one device to another?</string>
    <string name="help_export_import_covers_answer"><![CDATA[Images are big files, therefore it is not possible to store them directly in the database. To transfer them from one device to another, you now have two options:<br /><br />1- Directly use the export function to create MyLibraryImages.txt, which is a single file representing all your images. Please, be aware that this file can be very big (usually about 1.5Mo for every 10 elements but it can be more), therefore be sure that you have enough space on your phone or the export will probably fail. To recover your images, put the MyLibraryImages.txt file in the \"Download\" folder of your new device then use the import function (do not forget to check the dedicated checkbox).<br /><br />2- Just copy the \"MyLibrary\" folder (that is next to the \"Download\" folder) from your original device to your second device. Once this is done, the app will be able to show your covers on your new device if you made an \"mylibrary.db\" import with override. This won\'t work if you imported your data from an XLS file because XLS files cannot persist database ids and database ids are linked to covers.]]></string>
    <!--<string name="help_mylibrary_xls_import_question">Can I import a library from a XLS file?</string>-->
    <!--<string name="help_mylibrary_xls_import_answer">No you can\'t, at least not for now. To import a library, you need first to export it with the \"Save library for future imports\" box option checked.</string>-->
    <string name="help_import_xls_required_format_question">What is the required format (sheet names, column names, etc.) to make a successful Excel import?</string>
    <string name="help_import_xls_required_format_answer">The Excel file to import must have a particular format to be successfully imported. The best way to check this format is to add at least one book to your library, then make an Excel export and look at the format of the exported Excel file. The exported file format is the same as the required import format.</string>
    <string name="help_incomplete_xls_file_question">My exported XLS file is not complete!</string>
    <string name="help_incomplete_xls_file_answer">The XLS file is fine, the problem comes from your computer : just unplug your phone from it and replug it, that should solve your issue.</string>
    <string name="help_xls_comics_question">I can\'t find my comics in my XLS library</string>
    <string name="help_xls_comics_answer">They are in the second sheet of the file, check it out ;)</string>
    <string name="help_mylibrary.db_question">What type of file \'mylibrary.db\' is? Can I read it from my computer?</string>
    <string name="help_mylibrary_db_answer">\'mylibrary.db\' is a database file corresponding to your library. You can read it on a computer with SqliteBrowser, then export it as a CSV file, but I recommend to use the in-app XLS export instead.</string>

    <string name="help_buy_books_question">Is there any other way to help the application?</string>
    <string name="help_buy_books_answer">Yes!
